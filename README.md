# HTML Lab 1 Assignment: Build Your First Web Pages

Welcome to your first HTML lab for COGS3! In this lab, you'll create three simple web pages using basic HTML elements.

---

## ✅ Instructions

Create one `.html` file for each part of the lab using your **last name** in the filename.  
For example, if your last name is Lee, name your file: `LeeLab1PartA.html`

### Part A (in `PartA/LastnameLab1PartA.html`)
1. Go to the `PartA/` folder.
2. Create a new file named: `LastnameLab1PartA.html`
   - Replace `Lastname` with your actual last name (e.g., `SmithLab1PartA.html`)
3. Inside that file, include:
   - A `<title>` for your page
   - A `<h1>` with your name or topic
   - A `<p>` describing yourself or your favorite hobby
   - One `<img>` with a valid image URL
   - A `<ul>` or `<ol>` list of 3 things you learned this week

### Part B (in `PartB/LastnameLab1PartB.html`)
- Rename the file to use your last name
- Include at least **two new HTML tags** (e.g., `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<blockquote>`)
- Use consistent formatting and thoughtful structure

### Part C (in `PartC/LastnameLab1PartC.html`)
- Rename the file to use your last name
- Demonstrate creativity and layout
- Optionally add inline or internal CSS to enhance your page


## 📁 Folder Structure

Your repo should look like this:
```
html-lab1-template/
├── README.md
├── PartA/
│ └── LastnameLab1PartA.html
├── PartB/
│ └── LastnameLab1PartB.html
├── PartC/
│ └── LastnameLab1PartC.html
```


Each file should be renamed using your **own last name**.
